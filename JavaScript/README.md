# Hey!

Since javascript is meant to be used on the web, some portions of these notes would best be explained using HTML.

Some concepts don't need to have an HTML file and can be explained using the console in VSCode, but some can use
the extra demonstration. When you see an note at the top that says (! HMTL RECOMMENDED !), you can use an included 
HTML file to view the output. But when you come upon notes that have a warning (! HTML NEEDED !) at the top then the
code will only work properly inside the browser.

So, to use the included HTML, you need to run it using the VSCode Live Server extension.

To install the extension, click the Extensions button or Control + Shift + X and type "Live Server", then click 
install. Now when right clicking an HTML file, click "Open with live Server" and a tab will open in your default
browser with the HTML file running.
